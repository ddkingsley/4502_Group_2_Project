### Description of the project
Our goal for this project was to use data mining techniques on a dataset of Chicago crime information in order to uncover novel trends about crime in the city such as crime waves, trends, and clusters, through patterns and correlations between crime, location, and time. We hoped that the trends we uncovered could potentially help understand the factors causing crime in Chicago, provide insight leading to possible solutions, and provide law enforcement with predictive tools.

### Summary of questions and answers
In this project, we set out to answer the following questions:
- Is there a correlation between type of crime and location description or district?
- Do arrests occur more often in different locations for the same crime?
- What are the most common crimes for different areas?
- Are there periods when there were waves of certain types of crimes?
- Trends in crime types?
- Can an accurate model be generated for “arrest made” based on other information about a crime?
